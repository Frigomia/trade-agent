"""Reject oversized request bodies before FastAPI buffers and parses them.

FastAPI reads the whole body before authentication runs, so without a cap an anonymous caller
could exhaust the memory of the small production machine. Written as plain ASGI (not
BaseHTTPMiddleware) so a streamed body is counted chunk by chunk and never buffered here.
